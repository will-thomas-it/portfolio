        <p class="intro">
          I am an enthusiastic and self-motivated IT asset management professional with a passion for programming. Throughout my career as an ITAM, I realized the importance of leveraging expansive tools, which led me to delve into the world of programming.
          As a result, I have acquired proficiency in a diverse range of programming languages. My expertise lies in developing and maintaining responsive, user-friendly, and visually appealing websites using modern web development tools. I take pride in crafting digital experiences that seamlessly combine aesthetics and functionality.
          I strongly believe in the power of continual learning and critical thinking. I am always eager to broaden my knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends. My commitment to personal growth enables me to deliver my best work, particularly in team environments and under project-based timelines. I thrive when collaborating with colleagues, valuing open communication and the collective pursuit of excellence.

            <h3>Programming</h3>
            <p> 
              I began learning to code in college and I quickly fell in love with the process of generating my own works. I've been fortunate enough to have completed software development reskilling programs and coding bootcamps that have shaped my skillset. There is always more to learn and I can't wait to see what comes next.

              In my free time, I am an avid fly fisher. I love the outdoors and connecting with my surroundings. Fishing is a lifestyle that welcomes everyone. My goal has always been to enforce community over competition.
